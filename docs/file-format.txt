# Encrypted Private Key

[HEADER] - 20 bytes
4 bytes  : WRN in ASCII + Version (0x20 hex) (0x57524E20)
16 bytes : salt

[Encrypted Plaintext] - (Overhead of 16)
32 bytes : ciphertext of private key
16 bytes : ciphertext tag

The 4 byte magic header is included as additional authenticated data.
Salt is not included as AAD because it gets included as part of key
derivation. The chapoly nonce is fixed at zero because the scrypt salt is
random, resulting in a fresh key each time.
